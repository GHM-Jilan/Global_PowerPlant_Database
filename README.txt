Project Name: 
============
Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Power Plant Database.


Source of Data: 
==============
Title	: Global Power Plant Database
url	: http://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase


Dataset Description: 
===================
The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for oneâ€™s own analysis. The database covers approximately 35000 power plants from 167 countries, representing about 72% of the world's capacity and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type.


Requisite of this Project:
=========================
Through this project, a clear picture of the Global Power Sector was come into sight. This project will make the monitoring process of global power generation condition effective and easier; which will ultimately assist in better policy making of power generation on national and global level. 


Project Overview: 
================
In this project- the in depth analysis of the Global Power Plant dataset was performed in Python Programming Language. After carrying out different data cleaning & preprocessing steps (such as Feature Selection, Null Value Imputation, Dealing with Outliers etc.) Analysis phase was started. Statistical Analysis of the features was performed. About 20 vital information was extracted & visualized. Also, data was separated and analyzed based on renewable and nonrenewable type of fuels. Finally the key findings of the project was enlisted and future scope of work was stated. 


Project Completion Steps:
========================
1. Inspecting Dataset
2. Feature Selection 
3. Dealing with Missing Values
4. Inspecting Outliers 
5. Univariate Analysis of different features
6. Multivariate Analysis
	-(Extracting of 20 vital information about global power generation)
7. Summarizing the data of a particular country
8. Enlisting of key findings 
9. Stating Future scope of upgradation of this project 


Key Findings of the Project at a glance:
=======================================
1) The Global Power Generation Capacity is about 5700 GW. 

2) USA has the the most No. of power plants (9800). China has second most No. of power plants (4200).

3) China has the highest Generation Capacity (1400 GW) ; USA has the 2nd highest Generation Capacity (1200 GW).

4) Renewable fuel based plants Solar, Hydro & Wind run the most No. of plants. 

5) Coal based power plants produce the most amount of power in the world. Gas, Hydro & Nuclear are 2nd, 3rd & 4th in this list.

6) Nuclear type power plants has the most Avg. generation capacity per unit of plant(2100 MW). Solar & Wastage based plants has the least generation capacity per unit of plant (18 & 14 MW respectively).

7) Among the top 10 Power Plants with highest generation capacity, 7 are Hydro type plants which indicate the fact of huge potential power of water. 

8) USA owns the most No. of Nuclear Power Plants in the world (58). France holds the 2nd position with 19 Nuclear power plants. 

9) GLobal Percent of Renew generation =  26.92 % ; Percent of Non Renew generation =  73.08. So, Still almost three quarter of the global power generation is based on non-Renewables.

10) China generates the most amount of renewable energy, thanks to its gigantic Hydroelectric dams. USA is on the 2nd place with its huge No. of Solar, Hydro & Wind based plants.

11) Almost 96% of total power of Norway is generated from renewable sources. Almost 75% of total power of Brazil & Switzerland is generated from renewable sources. 

12) All of the top 10 years with highest new installation capacity, is in 21st Century; due to the invention of new generation technologies, ease of gathering materials to establish newer and newer plants etc.

13) With the available data, The average generation efficiency per year is about 30%.


Future scope of work:
====================
In Future, the project can be broadened to :
	- assess the relationship between Generation Capacity & GDP of countries.
	- assess the relationship between Global non-Renewable Generation & GLobal CO2 Emission.
